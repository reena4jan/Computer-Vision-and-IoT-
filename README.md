# Computer-Vision-and-IoT-AT The Spark Foundation

Overview:
Social distancing is possibly the only way to contain the spread of COVID-19. Recently, Andrew Ng’s Landing AI team created a Social Distancing Tool using the concepts of Computer Vision. This project is inspired by their work.

In this Social Distancing Detector, I’ll be using the weights of the YOLO v3 Object Detection Algorithm and the COCO dataset which are easily available online. Additionally, the main library being used will be the OpenCV along with the Deep Neural Network (dnn) module.
